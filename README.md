I created Online Clothing Store to learn how to work with Props, useState() and React Router.

* The project is based on React.
* The project contains 25 products by different categories.
* You can filter products using category buttons ("Dress", "Shoes", "Kids" etc.)
* Navigation on the site is implemented using Recat Router.
* Each product opens on a separate page with additional description.
